Prototype
=========

Todo:

- Fix flicker bug, figure out the movement so there are no gaps, including variable frame size, and overrun
- implement speed to movement
- Show in UI when a ship isn't being tracked anymore (Signal tracking)
- Figure out how to make non-moving ships pop up on sensors
- Better fluid movement

Further along:
- Sensor sensitivity / emissions
- World static objects (like stations and salvage)
- Populate with proceduraly generated salvage wrecks, very many thousands of them, to check performance
- Setup ships going between stations
- Look at AI and possibly other stuff
